# SCE17_codes
I converted to sioread.m file into sioread.py for use in python 3.6, jupyter notebook.
Using the file RAVA02* in this folder, you can run the self-contained jupyter code "process_acoustic.ipynb". 
It will produce a spectrogram of that data file as well as save the fft-ed data in a .npy file (already done here).

The requirements file runs in Mac with batch mode enabled.
